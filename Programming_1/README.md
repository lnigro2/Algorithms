## Program Description
---
This is a fairly straightforward program that I have created, which takes an ambiguous .txt file which contains a semicolon delimited list of integers and transforms it into a python list. The program then takes that list and runs it through an insertion sort algorithm, which will reproduce the original list of integers such that n`1 < n`2 < ... < n`n

## Algorithm Breakdown

## Compiler/Platform Used
---
I used the spyder platform to write the Isort.py program, and tested the program on the spyder IDE and the command line to make sure it worked in both environments. To write the README file, I used Sublime Text 3.

## What Does and What Does Not Work

## Data Structure Design
---
The data from the .txt file is stored in a python list format
