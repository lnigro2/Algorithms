The sorting problem:
	-Input: a sequence of n numbers
	-Output: a permutation of the input sequence such that n1 <= n2 <= .... <= n

Pseudocode of Insertion-Sort(A, n)		cost 	time

for j = 2 to n:							c1 		n
	key = A[j]							c2 		n - 1
	i = j - 1							c3 		n - 1
	while i > 0 and A[i] > key			c4		
		A[i + 1] = A[i]
		i = i-1
	A[i + 1] = key
